## First step : Generate Merged file

- From imported yearly data from Merra2, all the data must be merged alltogether. The merged data will not be stored in github.
The notebooks to merge are in : `nb_mergedatafiles/`, with one csv file per site

## Second first analysis and statistical properties of sites
- The notebooks to analyse the time sequences are in :   `nb_anastatprops/`


## More advanced time analysis using gaussian processes and Lomb-scagle frequency plots and Discrete Covariance Function 
- The notebooks are in `nb_ana_freq_and_fit/`
